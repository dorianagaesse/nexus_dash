# Changelog

Product releases use SemVer-style pre-1.0 versioning. Keep build identity
separate from product version: release entries describe `v0.x.y`, while commit
SHA, deployment URL, and workflow run belong in release evidence.

## Unreleased

- Define each release entry before the release PR is merged.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-20

- Made `package.json` the canonical product-version source.
- Changed the app metadata pill to show a clean product version instead of
  appending commit SHA build metadata to the visible label.
- Kept commit SHA, runtime environment, and repository URL as diagnostic
  deployment metadata.
- Updated Vercel deploy workflows to inject `APP_VERSION`, `APP_ENV`,
  `COMMIT_SHA`, and `APP_REPOSITORY_URL` from the checked-out ref.
