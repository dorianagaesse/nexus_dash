# ADR Folder

This folder stores architecture decision records and related decision notes.

## Files

- `adr/decisions.md`: chronological ADR log used by day-to-day development workflow.
- `adr/task-056-data-platform-adr.md`: detailed analysis for TASK-056 (PostgreSQL baseline + Supabase fit).

## Update Rule

When a task introduces a major architectural choice, add or update an entry in `adr/decisions.md` and link any detailed companion document in this folder.
