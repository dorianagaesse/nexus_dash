## Journal Usefulness

Helpful for development: **Yes**, if kept concise.

Most useful entries are:
- execution milestones tied to task IDs
- validation evidence (commands/checks)
- release evidence (PR + preview URL)

Low-value entries to avoid going forward:
- minor UI tweaks without task linkage
- repetitive step-by-step notes that already exist in PR history
